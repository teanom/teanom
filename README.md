## 🧭 Who I Am

I’m Marc Alvin Teano, but in the cyber space I go by **Teanom**—a fusion of my surname and purpose, inspired by the old-world menace of Tiamat. I’m a career-pivoting operator with a background in surgical logistics, critical environments, and frontline support. My fight began not behind a terminal, but standing under harsh lights, keeping uptime for surgeons and staff when failure wasn’t an option.

Now I bring that same discipline to the digital battlefield—training in SOC/NOC operations, incident response, and eventually, digital forensics.
